## General info

Use the lyrics.ovh API to search by either song or artist. The search results are added to the DOM with the respective 'Get Lyrics' to fecth the lyric for that song. It uses the response from the API to generate the pagination. Practice async/await and the use of third party API. Use of event bubbling for event delegation on the 'Get Lyrics' buttons.
